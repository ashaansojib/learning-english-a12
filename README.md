## About This Project..
* This is a full stack react project. This is a MERN Stack project. I am using here tailwind css and many technology.
* Mainly this is a course service provider website. Here have 3 type of roll. Here have an admin that control full website. An Admin can manage all content and all user.
* Role-Based Access Control: The website implements a role-based access control system to manage user permissions and privileges. It consists of three roles: admin, instructor, and student. The admin has full control over the website, including managing content and users, while instructors can create and manage their courses, and students have access to enroll in courses.
* Content Management: The admin role encompasses content management, allowing administrators to create, edit, and delete course content. This includes managing course descriptions, lesson materials, assessments, and other related resources. The content management system ensures that the website is up to date with relevant and high-quality course materials.
* User Management: The admin role also involves user management, giving administrators the ability to oversee and control user accounts. This includes user registration, authentication, and authorization processes. The admin can manage user roles, review user activity, and handle user-related issues, ensuring a secure and organized user experience on the website.
